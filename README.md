# Hello and Welcome!


My name is Laura and I'm stoked you're on my page! I hope you like what you see, and if you don't ......
reach out! Would love to hear your opinions ðŸ™‚ and take it as an opportuinity to grow. 
I'd actually find it quite flattering if you reached out. Not only would it entail that you checked out my stuff long enough to 
have an opinion on it, but we might find out we're into the same things! Then we can be buddies, or at least feel rest assured that 
the other is actually not a bot. 

Here are some non coding related things I'm into
- Movies - right now it's been a lot of Kung Fu movies and Samurai for me but I'll watch almost anything. 
- Video Games - The Last of Us 2 is my favorite game ever. But I also love Fall Out, God of War, the original Last of Us and Spider-Man to name a few. 
- Watching animation
- Hanging out with my cats (shoutout to my cats!)

# Hello and Welcome!


My name is Laura and I'm stoked you're on my page! I hope you like what you see, and if you don't ......
reach out! Would love to hear your opinions ðŸ™‚ and take it as an opportuinity to grow. 
I'd actually find it quite flattering if you reached out. Not only would it entail that you checked out my stuff long enough to 
have an opinion on it, but we might find out we're into the same things! Then we can be buddies, or at least feel rest assured that 
the other is actually not a bot. 

Anyway ..... about me, I guess?

I really liked to write when I was younger, so long story short I majored in Journalism and graduated in 2020 with a degree. I tried it out for a bit at the end of 2021 and found out it was NOT my thing.
But that's okay, because before I completely pivoted, I had already started dabbling into programming. More specifically, trying to intertwine programming with journalism. Something like Data Journalism or Data Visualizations, which led me to teach myself Python (shoutout to Codecademy!) and was eventually using pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and other Python packages to aid me in reasearching large data sets. 

After a stint as a journalist, I enrolled in a Full Stack Developer bootcamp which I started in late February. Not too long after that, I was lucky enough to be hired as a Quality Assurance Intern for SpringBig. A Software as a Service (SaaS) company that works as a Loyalty Program for the Cannabis Industry. (shoutout to SpringBig!) I will spare you the details (you can find details about what I do at my job in my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-antunez-2a4a12182/)) but after 3 months they hired me and that's where I'm at now. ðŸ˜Ž

So now here we are in the present, graduated from the bootcamp in August and working as a QA Engineer at SpringBig. Within the next year I intend to pursue Full Stack Development from QA work and I'm excited for the transition. 

If you've read this long, I really wish I could give you a token of my appreciation because wow I don't know if I would've done the same. ðŸ˜… But you are obviously awesome for doing that, so to bring it back, let's be buddies! At least coding buddies, so we can inspire and learn from one another to maybe make something really cool.

Here are some non coding related things I'm into
- Movies - right now it's been a lot of Kung Fu movies and Samurai for me but I'll watch almost anything. 
- Video Games - The Last of Us 2 is my favorite game ever. But I also love Fall Out, God of War, the original Last of Us and Spider-Man to name a few. 
- Watching animation
- Hanging out with my cats (shoutout to my cats!)
